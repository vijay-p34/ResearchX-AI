# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build ResearchPilot, an academic research management hub with paper storage, search, organization, AI-stored summaries/Q&A, and a dark academic UI — all backed by a single Motoko actor.

**Planned changes:**

### Backend (Motoko Actor)
- Store academic paper records with fields: id, title, authors, abstract, url, tags, dateAdded, notes
- CRUD operations: `addPaper`, `getPapers`, `getPaperById`, `updatePaperNotes`, `updatePaperTags`, `deletePaper`
- Search endpoint: case-insensitive keyword matching across title, abstract, authors; filter by tag
- Summary & Q&A storage per paper: `saveSummary`, `getSummary`, `addQAEntry`, `getQAEntries`

### Frontend Pages
- **Paper Discovery page:** Search bar, results as paper cards (title, authors, abstract snippet, tags), "Save to Library" button, empty state message
- **Research Library page:** Grid/list of all saved papers, filter by tag, sort by date added or title, links to detail view
- **Paper Detail page:** Full metadata display, editable notes field, AI Summary section, Q&A section with ability to add new questions
- **Research Insights Dashboard:** Total paper count, top tags with counts, last 5 added papers, static recommendation placeholder cards

### UI & Assets
- Dark academic theme: deep navy/charcoal backgrounds, warm amber and off-white typography, serif-inspired headings, paper-texture-like cards, hover micro-interactions
- Sidebar navigation present on all pages
- App logo (`researchpilot-logo.png`) in sidebar/header; hero background (`dashboard-hero.png`) on dashboard
- Images loaded from `frontend/public/assets/generated`

**User-visible outcome:** Users can search for and save academic papers, organize them with tags and notes, view AI-stored summaries and Q&A per paper, and get a high-level overview of their research library — all within a polished dark academic interface.
